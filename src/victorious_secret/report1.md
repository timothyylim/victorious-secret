#Report One

During the initial phase the group develops a product specification on the basis of discussions with the supervisor, and decides on the development approach that will be used to conduct their project.

The group should try to establish what resources (hardware and software) will be required. It is very important that, with advice from your supervisor, you come to an agreement on what techniques (e.g., which programming languages) you will use to implement the project. The amount of time available means that you may not be able to switch techniques at a later stage.

Note that you are required to use a version control system (VCS) in your project, and Report One should mention which VCS you are using.

# Contents of Report One

This is a very important document, which includes the external specification of the project. This means it should describe what functionality you are setting out to provide with your final product. It is in a way a "contract" between your project supervisor (who will evaluate your work) and you. It should contain clearly stated minimum specifications that you underta ke to provide. If your final project meets these minimum specifications, you will in general get at least a B grade. It is therefore very important that you negotiate these minimum specifications with your supervisor in such a way that there is clear understanding on both sides and that you are confident that you can achieve them. Furthermore, this report should also outline your ideas for how you might be able to extend your work to provide more than the agreed minimum. Completing such extensions will in general mean that your grade will be better than a B.

The report should clearly identify the requirements of the project using goal oriented-capture, categorize (essential vs. non-essential) and prioritize each requirement, assess their feasibility, decide on planned completion dates, and discuss the overall boundaries of your system. A lecture on capturing requirements will be given in the associated Software Engineering course before this report is due, which will provide more details on all these aspects.

Furthermore, the report should identify the development strategy chosen by your group (e.g., Scrum, XP programming) and how you are using it in the context of your project. You should include here information about the division of work.

Report One should be between 2 and 5 pages using an 11-point font size, with 2cm margins all around, and spaced normally. You are required to use Latex to type your reports. We recommend to use the provided template that can be found on CATE.

If you are unfamiliar with Latex, there is plenty of documentation available on the Internet; a good starting point is http://www.latex-project.org/.

Reports must be submitted via CATE by their deadlines; no extensions will be granted.
